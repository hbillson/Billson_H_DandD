# Drag and Drop Game (Crushing Bugs)
Using the Drag and Drop Game build we did in class, I have fixed a few bugs and made it work the way it's supposed to. My updates include: 1) preventing the player from dropping two pieces onto one spot and 2) adding a working Reset button & function that removes all of the pieces from the areas on the board and puts them back into the Drag Zone. 

## How to Play 
- Select the puzzle you want to build by clicking one of the thumbnails at the bottom. This will change the pieces and the puzzle's background. 
- Drag the pieces from the Drag Zone on the left onto one of the four corners of the game board. 
- If you'd like to start over, or if your puzzle is complete and you'd like to try another, click the Reset button. This will wipe the board and put your pieces back in the Drag zone.
